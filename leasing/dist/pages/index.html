        <p class="how-does__text">Leasing a vehicle is essentially entering into a long term rental agreement for that
          vehicle. Unlike a traditional car purchase, you donâ€™t actually own the vehicle. Instead, a leasing company
          purchases the vehicle from the dealer on your behalf and then you make monthly payments to the leasing company
          for the duration of your lease. Some leases however, do provide the option to purchase the vehicle at the end
          of the lease.</p>
